Instructions

    Create a web application in Angular that consumes Github API and meets the requirements in the section below.
    Although not mandatory, we will really appreciate it if you are willing to spend some extra time and complete as much bonus points as possible.
    Push your new repository in your Github account and make it private.
    Send us the links to your Github repository and the deployed application

Requirements

    There must be a search bar to let the user search by username (login name)

    After the search is completed, the application displays the list of users along
     with their avatar and their username on the same page. 

    To simplify the exercise, in case there are too many results you can limit them 
    at a certain maximum.

    When a list item is clicked, the application navigates to a new page that displays a 
    simple list with all the user details.
   
    The new page will also display the list of the user's repositories and followers.
    
    The application has to be responsive and optimized for mobile

    Documentation on how the application works and how to set up and build the project 
    must be provided.
   
    Make sure that the application is production-ready.

    The application reuses visual components across the app.

    The application uses a solid-state management pattern across the app.

Bonus points

    The application uses a state-management library (Redux, Akita,…)

    The search input does the searching as you type (See google search as an example)

    There is an animated transition between pages

    The application supports theming and can easily be switched between themes

    The application style is built by one of the CSS preprocessors or CSS-in-JS

    The application uses lazy-loading to load modules dynamically

    Add a spinner meanwhile data is loading.

    Create some basic Unit Testing

    The application uses an Interceptor to catch the errors that might be happening 
    whenever the API Call fails.

    Use Reactive Forms to handle the interaction with the search bar.

Expected solution

    Properly meets all the requirements
    All pages' URL is reusable - meaning it can be copied and pasted on different browser and 
    still shows the same result.
    The project supports code splitting for each pages by properly using the Angular components.
    Analyse that the app is production ready by using Google’s PageSpeed or Lighthouse.



As stated in the instructions, we will appreciate it if you can do as many bonus points as possible.
